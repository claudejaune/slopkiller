# AI Slop examples

This is the kind of post that qualifies as slop. All the red flags are maked in **bold** text. There are probably others.

Just wrapped up interviews for a cybersecurity role.

Not a single candidate could explain how the tools they use actually work.

"I run Nmap scans." Great. What happens when you use the -sS flag? Silence.

"I'm certified in Burp Suite." Perfect. Explain how it intercepts HTTPS traffic. Blank stare.

**Here's the uncomfortable truth: We're producing tool operators, not security professionals.**

I've trained students across multiple institutions. I've seen this pattern repeat endlessly. People memorize tool commands, chase certifications, and wonder why they can't land jobs.

Meanwhile, CISOs are desperate for talent.
**The gap isn't jobs. It's understanding.**

Real cybersecurity professionals:

 • Understand protocols before they scan them

 • Know what happens at Layer 3 when they run a tool

 • Can troubleshoot when automated scans fail

 • Think like attackers, not button-clickers

Tools are essential. But they're the means, not the end.

When you understand the fundamentals:

• **You know why a tool works**

 **• You recognize when it's giving false positives**

 **• You can build custom solutions**

 **• You become invaluable, not replaceable**
 
To aspiring cybersecurity professionals: Stop chasing the next shiny certification. Start understanding TCP/IP. Read RFCs. Break things in labs. Ask "why" until the concept clicks.

To hiring managers: Stop filtering resumes by certification count. Start testing fundamental understanding in interviews.

**The industry doesn't need more tool operators.**

**It needs more problem solvers.**

The biggest threat today is that schools still haven’t accepted that education system must change now. We’re educating children for a world that no longer exists. And are still obsessed with grades,memorisation, and linear career paths. Most schools still teach what to think and not how to think.

Why is it hard to accept that AI has already solved access to information and it’s cheap and accessible. This doesn't mean teachers will be displaced. But learning technology cannot be only limited to computer science as a subject. AI will intersect in every aspect of learning from math, chemistry, physics, language, art and everything.

**The opportunity isn’t to sell AI to kids. It’s to re-wire how learning happens inside schools using AI to be more curious to ask better questions and and build things early.** This concept of the nerdy kid in the computer lab will no longer exist. A child interested in art, science, or language can now create useful tools. We have to change the way kids are educated. Now!

You've spent millions on antivirus, EDR, and SIEM, yet you are still blind to the real threat.  
  
While your dashboards proudly report “0 threats detected,” attackers are already inside, using your own credentials, tools, and infrastructure against you. **No malware. No alerts. No alarms.**  
  
**Welcome to the malware-free era, where 79% of cyberattacks don’t deploy malware at all. Instead, they live off the land, hiding in legitimate processes, abusing admin tools, and slipping through every “next-gen” defense.**  
  
**This is the biggest shift in cybersecurity in over a decade, and most organizations are still looking the wrong way.**  
  
Our latest article, “The Invisible Threat,” explains why this change happened, why your current stack can’t see it, and what modern defenses actually work in a malware-free world.  
  
**If your strategy still revolves around catching malware, you’re already fighting the last war.**

We walk past them every day, a local Kirana, a chemist, a small parlour. What if they were the answer to India's logistics puzzle?

For the companyname yyyyyy, my team with xxxxxxx and xxxxxx tackled a fascinating concept: xxxxx.

The premise was simple but ambitious: instead of hiring a fleet of full-time riders, what if we enabled local shopkeepers (which we call Latent Personas) to deliver parcels within their own 200-meter neighborhoods? 

**On paper, it may sound perfect. But in reality, it’s an operational challenge.**
**We realised early on that this isn't just a logistics problem, but a human one.** A busy chemist or a single mother running a parlour won't adopt a complex tech stack just for some side income.

**So, we can't just pitch the idea, we had to design the execution roadmap** to make it actually feasible:

- Milk Run Model: We moved away from traditional hubs to a streamlined drop-off system that respects the shopkeeper's limited space.  

- Creating Trust: One of the biggest hurdles in delivery is fraud. We designed a Dual-QR handover that leverages the shopkeeper's community reputation to stop leaks. 

- Tech for Non-Techies: We proposed a WhatsApp-first interface because we knew that for someone like Sunita (one of our personas), a complicated app can be a dealbreaker.

- Stress Testing: We picked Varanasi and Hisar for our pilot designs, using their narrow lanes and unique layouts to truly test the model's limits. 

A Human Angle:
Midway through the challenge, we stopped looking at xxxxx (our Kirana persona) and xxxxx"as just data points on a map. 
We realised that for this to work, **we had to also solve for their dignity and convenience, not just our cost-per-delivery.**

It’s still an unproven concept in many ways, but the potential to turn that idle time into income for millions of small business owners is something worth exploring.

I've helped multiple businesses scale past $1M with SEO. (**My secret? Ranking for keywords with zero competition**) I just spent 12 hours building a database of 200 keywords that turn google searches into phone calls. Here's what's inside: → 200 high-intent keywords your competitors aren't targeting → Emergency service terms (convert 2-3x higher than standard keywords) → Government grant keywords (people searching "heat pump grant" are ready to buy) → Commercial keywords for bigger contracts (less competition, higher value) → Search volume + difficulty + buyer intent rating for each → Sorted by quick wins vs long-term targets → Covers boilers, solar, heat pumps, EV chargers, windows/doors This is the same keyword database behind Boiler Central ($12M) and Value Doors ($4.5M). **Most agencies are still targeting keywords from 2022. These are the ones working in 2026**. Want the full database? 1. Like this post 2. Comment "KEYWORDS" I'll send it over.

**The headline isn’t ‘Claude stays free.’ It’s ‘Claude won’t monetize attention** — it will monetize institutional trust.’ In regulated, high-risk environments, **conflict-free AI isn’t a feature — it’s the price of admission.** Free access builds literacy. Paid deployment builds infrastructure. **This is a message designed to travel through boardrooms, legal reviews, procurement pipelines, and hiring funnels — not trending tabs. Less platform. More infrastructure.**

Not-so-hot take: **Layoffs aren’t happening because AI is replacing these roles. They’re happening because companies spent too much money on AI.**

11 days to launch. Only 4 hours of preparation.  
Yes, at global scale.  

**When xxxx launched its global Marketing & Sales Awards across 70+ countries, speed wasn’t optional.**  
   
**Here’s what made it possible:**  
• Fast deployment: live in 11 days  
• Only 4 hours of preparation with central teams  
• Standardized submissions (context, KPIs, ROI)  
• Transparent voting & scoring  
• Real-time executive dashboards  
   
**No endless workshops.**  
**No heavy change management.**  
**Just a clear framework, deployed fast with xxxxx.**  
**The results**? 700 interesting initiatives shared across all countries.  
   
This is what operational simplicity at enterprise scale looks like.

On the sidelines, it’s easy to debate the future of the company. But for employees who spent a decade building it, the dilemma is very different.  
Every single day they don't sell, they're deciding this stock is better than cash, better than diversifying, better than any other place they could put that money.  
  
Eternal went through a similar pattern. Listed at ₹115. Dropped to ~₹46. But after a few months, the stock rallied and is now priced at ~₹287. Which is 6x from the bottom.  
  
ESOP wealth journeys are rarely linear. The path from grant to realized wealth almost never goes in a straight line.  
  
That's why patience matters when you're holding equity in a company you helped build. But patience doesn't mean holding on forever. Balancing risk with conviction is key here.  
  
**Instead of panic selling all at once, selling your shares in stages can help reduce concentration gradually. But how do you decide what to sell and when?**  
  
**Ask yourself: How much liquidity do you actually need? How much conviction do you still have in the business? How concentrated is your wealth in this one asset?**  
  
These answers will shape your approach to the ESOPs you spent years earning.  
  
**The market may decide what your ESOPs are worth, but your timing and discipline determine how much of that wealth you actually keep.**

Why do some talented people perform inconsistently — and then suddenly improve?  
  
I learned this lesson years ago while working with a high-potential engineer.  
  
He had already proven his capability before.  
Delivered impactful work.  
Strong technical foundation.  
  
But performance had become inconsistent.  
Momentum kept breaking.  
Confidence was dropping.  
  
**At the same time, the pressure wasn’t only on him.**  
  
**It was on me as well.**  
  
There was expectation to scrutinize more and “Fix the performance problem.”  
  
But something inside me resisted that approach.  
  
It was what I now understand as Servant Leadership Wiring — the instinct to maintain integrity, build trust, and enable growth.  
  
So I chose a different path. I got to ground myself first.  
  
**I scheduled a 1:1.**  
  
**Not to lecture.**  
**Not to warn.**  
**But to listen.**  
  
I asked what was really blocking him.  
What was draining his energy.  
What support he actually needed.  
I guaranteed that I hear him. I guaranteed that I am with him.  
  
A week later, I scheduled another 1:1.  
  
This time I said something simple, but intentional:  
  
“I trust your potential. I’ve seen what you can do. Let’s rebuild momentum together.”  
  
**No threats.**  
**No pressure tactics.**  
**Just clarity, trust, and direction.**  
  
**What happened over the next two months still stays with me.**  
  
- Delivered a solution across 20 micro-services  
- Improved the performance of application by 40%  
- Won in Innovation Ideas Competition  
- Reduced infra cost by 10% by bringing proposals to re-configure.  
  
He did wonders. It took just two 1:1s. But it is more than that.  
**What changed?**  
**Not tools.**  
**Not salary.**  
**Not workload.**  
  
**The leadership approach changed.**  
  
That experience reshaped how I lead today. The experience shaped how anyone can flourish with great leadership.  
  
**Because servant leadership isn’t about being “soft”.**  
**It’s about having the courage to stand firm on values** — even when pressure pushes you to control instead of trust.  
  
If you lead teams, remember this:  
  
**Sometimes performance doesn’t need more pressure.**  
**It needs Servant Leadership Wiring.**  
It needs trust, empathy, motivation and tapping on their potential.  
It also needs collaborative finding strength as a team and aligning accordingly.

Some people help you build quietly.  
**No titles. No expectations. No announcements.**  
  
xxxx has been helping me build xxxx from a time when it did not even have a name. Before there was a studio, a pitch deck, or even clarity on what this would eventually become. He was showing up purely out of passion and belief in the work.  
  
**There were no contracts or promises. Just a lot of conversations, a lot of thinking, and a shared care for how things should be done. Craft mattered. People mattered. Shortcuts never really felt like an option.**  
  
Eventually, we had a conversation and xxxx decided to join us full time. All he said was “Jo hoga, Dekha jayega!”.  
From that point on, xxxxx started feeling different. Not louder or faster, just more solid. The work improved. The thinking got clearer. And I finally felt like I had someone alongside me who cared about the craft as deeply as I did.  
  
**Finding a cofounder is not about resumes or complementary skill sets. It is about finding someone who sees the same problems you see**, gets excited by the same details, and is willing to sit through the boring and uncomfortable parts of building something. **It is about trust, taste, and how someone behaves when no one is watching.**

**This is not a new chapter. It is just acknowledging the role he has already been playing from day one.**

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) used to be about quietly intercepting traffic and stealing passwords.**  
Attackers have leveled up, and AITM now bypasses MFA altogether by stealing live session cookies.  
**It’s no longer enough to block phishing links or tighten MFA prompts. Modern identity attacks require modern defenses.**  
Certificate-based authentication makes things a lot simpler.  
You don’t rely on passwords; there are no session cookies to steal, and attackers can’t relay or replay anything in the middle.  
Swipe through to see how MITM and AITM actually work, and why certificates stop both cold.

There’s still a big issue in the German tech job market that rarely gets addressed openly:  
  
Too many companies are hiring in German only, even for tech roles where English is the actual working language.  
  
We see highly skilled international IT professionals every day.  
Strong experience. Relevant tech stacks. Solid interviews.  
But without B2 German yet, they are often ignored completely.  
  
**Yes, German matters.**  
**Yes, learning the language is important for long-term success.**  
**But requiring B2/C1 German before someone can even get hired means Germany is overlooking a huge amount of available talent, especially in IT and tech.**  
  
This needs to change.  
  
If you’re an international tech professional in Germany and want to work in English-speaking roles, get in touch with me. I know which companies truly work in English, how to position candidates correctly, and how to navigate the German hiring process realistically.  
  
**German doesn’t have to be perfect on day one.**  
**Talent shouldn’t be ignored because of it.**

Finally… we are live. 🤍  
  
**This doesn’t feel like a launch.**  
**It feels like relief, pride, and a lot of gratitude**—all at once.  
  
xxx was built quietly.  
In late nights, endless discussions, self-doubt, small wins, and a belief that this needed to exist.  
  
**I didn’t start with a business plan.**  
**I started with a feeling**—that our men deserve everyday clothing that’s rooted in respect, comfort, and culture.  
**Not occasion wear. Not trends. Just something you naturally reach for.**  
  
**This brand isn’t perfect.**  
**But it’s honest. Intentional.** And built with heart.  
  
Today is Day 1.  
And I couldn’t be more grateful.

Because if you’re monitoring bridges, tunnels, wind assets, or concrete structures, real strain takes real time.  
  
🎥 In this demo, we validate xxxxxx passive RF sensor concept for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) - showing how a structure can be “interrogated” wirelessly and tracked through resonance behaviour.  
📌 **No batteries.**  
**📌 No wiring.**  
**📌 Just passive RF physics + a clean measurement setup.**  
  
⚡️If you can spare 5 minutes, I promise you’ll walk away with a clear sense of:  
✅ what we built  
✅ why it works  
✅ why this can scale into real infrastructure deployments  
  
And yes… I’m asking you to “strain” the LinkedIn algorithm and watch the whole thing 😅

**Cybersecurity can no longer be treated as a collection of tools. It must evolve into infrastructure.**  
   
In this xxxxx opinion piece, our Founder & CEO, xxxxxx outlines why Cybersecurity-as-an-Infrastructure (CSaaI) is critical for modern enterprises, with identity acting as the control plane for access, trust, and risk across hybrid environments.  
   
This perspective is aimed at helping CISOs rethink security architecture for scale, resilience, and simplicity.

**Technical writing isn’t about removing creativity. It’s about redirecting it.**

Very early in my career, I was told by someone that technical writing sounded extremely boring as a profession and the least creative form of writing. Of course, this person worked as a copywriter at an advertising agency, so I believed them.

**But they were wrong.** 

Over the years, I’ve learned that creativity in technical writing shows up in quiet ways. It’s in deciding how to organize information so a new user doesn’t feel overwhelmed. It’s finding language that bridges the gap between expert knowledge and practical understanding. It’s turning a dense workflow into something someone can actually follow at 2:00 AM when something breaks, and they just need an answer.

**Some of the most creative work I’ve done never looked creative on the surface. It looked like cleaning up documentation that no one trusted.** It looked like rebuilding knowledge systems to enable teams to move faster. It looked like rewriting instructions, so support ticket volume dropped, and onboarding stopped being painful.

But beneath it all was the same creative process every great writer uses: empathy, storytelling, and problem-solving.

The longer I work in this field, the more convinced I am that effective technical writing lives at the intersection of logic and imagination.

And honestly, that’s what keeps it interesting.

🎇Congratulations on these remarkable results. Seeing quarterly cloud revenue cross the $50 billion threshold is a testament to both a massive shift in TAM and world-class execution.
**The transition toward an "agent-first" ecosystem is particularly compelling**; treating agents as the new apps clarifies the future of software. **Furthermore**, your focus on "tokens per watt" and infrastructure efficiency with xxxx  200 demonstrates a sustainable approach to scaling intelligence. With 15 million M365 Copilot seats and significant GitHub growth, it is clear that AI has moved from experimental to essential. I believe this is an **inspiring blueprint for the next era of productivity**.👏

🚨 A new AI race just started. Most people haven’t noticed yet.  
  
**While everyone is busy talking about ChatGPT, something more interesting is happening quietly.**  
  
Two new players are pushing AI from “helpful tools” to real digital workers:  
  
• MoltBot  
An open-source personal AI assistant that runs locally on your device.  
It connects with WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more to clear inboxes, manage calendars, and automate workflows.  
**This isn’t chat-first AI. It executes tasks end to end, even while you sleep.**  
  
• RentAHuman AI  
Building the bridge between AI agents and the physical world.  
AI can think and plan, but it can’t act IRL. RentAHuman lets AI agents hire real humans as their hands, eyes, and feet.  
Digital intelligence paired with physical execution.  
  
**This isn’t about prompts anymore.**  
**This is about AI replacing roles, not tasks.**  
  
We’re entering a phase where:  
• AI works continuously, not on demand  
• AI owns outcomes, not just suggestions  
• AI becomes cheaper than hiring, faster than teams, and instantly scalable  
**The real shift?**  
  
**Founders won’t ask, “Which tool should we use?”**  
  
**They’ll ask, “Which roles should be AI-first?”**  
  
If you’re building products, hiring teams, or investing, this matters more than the next model release.  
  
**The AI race is no longer model vs model.**  
**It’s human roles vs AI agents.**  
  
Curious to hear:  
Which job do you think AI will fully replace first? 👇 Comment below
